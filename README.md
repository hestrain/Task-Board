## Features
You are able to create tasks with a title, due date (selected using a dropdown calendar), and a description.
The tasks auto-populate the "to-do" column, and then you can drag them to the other columns. 

if the date is past due the task will turn red, if the date is today the task will be yellow, and tasks in the future, and tasks in the "done" column will be white. 

you can delete tasks from the board as well.
